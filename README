#  ImportIMDbRatingsIntoTrakt.pl - import IMDb into Trakt
#
#  ==  Syntax  ==
#  % perl ImportIMDbRatingsIntoTrakt.pl IMDbRatings.csv
#
#  ==  Overview  ==
#  This script will import your ratings from IMDb into
#  Trakt.
#
#  ==  Instructions  ==
#  This script should be able to run on all platforms
#  that support Perl and the dependencies below.
#
#  To use this script, you will need to perform the
#  following steps.
#
#   1. Make sure you have Perl installed. I recommend
#      ActiveState's ActivePerl.
#   2. Make sure you have the following dependencies
#      before starting. Some come with ActivePerl.
#      For those that don't you can download them from
#      CPAN.org or use the "cpan" command-line program
#      once you install ActiveState's ActivePerl.
#
#      Digest::SHA1
#      LWP
#      Time::HiRes
#      File::Slurp
#      Log::Log4perl
#      Text::CSV
#      URI::Escape
#      JSON
#
#   3. Login to trakt.tv. <http://trakt.tv/>
#   4. Get your API key (everyone has one). <http://trakt.tv/settings/api>
#   5. Enter your trakt.tv username, password,
#      and API key below where it says "<Enter Value Here>". Save!
#   6. Optionally change LOVE_MINIMUM to your desired value.
#      All ratings equal or higher than this value on IMDb
#      will be rated as "Love" or "Totally ninja!" on trakt.tv.
#      All others will be rated as "Hate" or "Weak sauce :(".
#   7. Login to IMDb, one of the most awesome Web sites, ever!
#   9. Save your IMDb ratings to a file using the following link.
#      <http://www.imdb.com/list/export?list_id=ratings>

#      IMDb ratings saved in Step 7. (See "Syntax" above.)
#  10. Voil√†!

#      patches to the project's GitHub site.
